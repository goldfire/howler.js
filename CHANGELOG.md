## 2.0.0 (July 19, 2016)
This major release contains just a few breaking changes outlined below. Howler.js has been rewritten from the ground up using the knowledge and work since the initial release. There's a long list of additions and improvements, which I urge you to read through as the library has evolved quite a bit over this time.

The biggest change is how you should think about your audio when using howler.js. There is now the concept of global (`Howler`), group (`Howl`) and single sound (`Sound`). Each sound that is played gets its own `Sound` object that can be manipulated, giving much greater control over playback, whether using sprites or not. `Howl` method calls can then apply to one sound or all in the group.

```
Howler (global) ->
        Howl (group) ->
                Sound (single)
```

Howler.js now also has the concept of plugins. The core represents 100% compatibility across hTML5 Audio and Web Audio, adhering to the initial goals of the library. There is also a new Spatial Plugin that adds 3D and stereo audio support only available in the Web Audio API.

Read more about the update [in this blog post](http://goldfirestudios.com/blog/143/howler.js-v2.0-Released).

### Breaking Changes
- The `buffer` option is now named `html5`. Use this to force HTML5 Audio usage.
- The `urls` option is now named `src` to specify the audio file(s) to play.
- The `pos` method has been renamed to `seek`.

```javascript
// Change the seek position of a sound (in seconds).
sound.seek(10);
```

- `mute` and `unmute` have been consolidated into `mute`.

```javascript
// Mute a sound (or all sounds).
sound.mute(true);
Howler.mute(true);

// Unmute a sound (or all sounds).
sound.mute(false);
Howler.mute(false);
```

- The `play` method no longer takes a callback and immediately returns the playback sound id (this means you can no longer chain onto the `play` method, but all others work the same).

```javascript
// Get sound id for a specific playback.
var id = sound.play();

// Pause this playback.
sound.pause(id);
```

- The deprecated `fadeIn` and `fadeOut` methods have been removed in favor of the single `fade` method.

```javascript
// Fade in a sound.
sound.fade(0, 1, 1000);

// Fade out the sound once the previous fade has ended.
sound.once('fade', function(){
  sound.fade(1, 0, 1000);
});
```

### New Features
- Lots of general code cleanup, simplification and reorganization.
- Howler.js is now modularized. The core represents the initial goal for howler.js with 100% compatibility across HTML5 Audio and Web Audio. The spatial plugin adds spatial and stereo support through Web Audio API.
- The new structure allows for full control of sprite playback (this was buggy or didn't work at all before).
- New `once` method to setup event listeners that will automatically remove themselves once fired.
- New `playing` method that will return `true` if the specified sound is currently playing.
- New `duration` method that will return the duration of the audio source.
- New `state` method that will return the loaded state of the Howl.
- New `preload` option to allow disabling the auto-preload functionality.
- New events: `fade`, `stop`, `mute`, `volume`, `rate`, `seek`.
- New `rate` method that allows changing playback rate at runtime.
- New global `unload` method that unloads all active Howls and resets the `AudioContext` to clear memory.
- New `pool` option to allow setting the inactive sound pool size (for advanced use, still defaults to 5).
- Support for playback of Dolby Audio files.
- Support for .webm extension in addition to .weba.
- Support for playback of CAFF audio files.
- (Spatial) New `Howler` listener methods `stereo`, `pos` and `orientation`.
- (Spatial) New `Howl` methods `stereo`, `pos`, `orientation` and `pannerAttr` to control stereo and spatial audio of single sounds or groups of sounds.
- (Spatial) `pannerAttr` allows for control of `coneInnerAngle`, `coneOUterAngle`, `coneOuterGain`, `distanceModel`, `maxDistance`, `panningModel`, `refDistance` and `rolloffFactor`.
- Third parameter to `on`, `once` and `off` to allow listening or removing events for only a specific sound id.
- The following methods now alter all sounds within a `Howl` group when no `id` is passed: `pause`, `stop`, `volume`, `fade`, `mute`, `loop`, `rate`.
- New codec recommendations and notes have been added to the documentation.
- Web Audio AudioContext now automatically suspends and resumes to lower processing and power usage.

### Bug Fixes
- Improved the `ext` option and made it especially usefully for playing streams (for example, SoundCloud).
- The `fade` method now uses native Web Audio fading when in that mode.
- Fades are now automatically stopped when a new one is started, volume is changed or the sound is paused/stopped.

- `ADDED` Pass the `Howl` object reference as the first parameter in the custom event callbacks.

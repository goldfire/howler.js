## Description
This example displays how to construct a basic audio player using howler.js as the engine powering it. The only outside framework being used is [SiriWave.js](https://github.com/CaffeinaLab/SiriWaveJS) to provide some visual sugar.
This example visualizes how audio sprites work and demonstrates how they can be used within howler.js. Click on a sprite on the waveform to play it back and watch the progress (multiple clicks will overlap sounds).

* Audio sprite support with single audio file.
* Displays playback progress of sprites in real-time.
* Allows playback of multiple sprites on top of each other.
* Full-screen and responsive for desktop/mobile.

# Description
[howler.js](https://howlerjs.com) is an audio library for the modern web. It defaults to [Web Audio API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/) and falls back to [HTML5 Audio](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-audio-element). This makes working with audio in JavaScript easy and reliable across all platforms.

Additional information, live demos and a user showcase are available at [howlerjs.com](https://howlerjs.com).

### Quick Start

Several options to get up and running:

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js.git`
* Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/howler): `npm install howler`
* Install with [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install howler`
* Hosted CDN: [`cdnjs`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/howler) [`jsDelivr`](https://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/howler.js)

In the browser:

```html
<script src="/path/to/howler.js"></script>
<script>
    var sound = new Howl({
      src: ['sound.webm', 'sound.mp3']
    });
</script>
```

### Examples

##### Most basic, play an MP3:
```javascript
var sound = new Howl({
  src: ['sound.mp3']
});

sound.play();
```

##### More playback options:
```javascript
var sound = new Howl({
  src: ['sound.webm', 'sound.mp3', 'sound.wav'],
  autoplay: true,
  loop: true,
  volume: 0.5,
  onend: function() {
    console.log('Finished!');
  }
});
```

##### Define and play a sound sprite:
```javascript
var sound = new Howl({
  src: ['sounds.webm', 'sounds.mp3'],
  sprite: {
    blast: [0, 3000],
    laser: [4000, 1000],
    winner: [6000, 5000]
  }
});

// Shoot the laser!
sound.play('laser');
```

##### Listen for events:
```javascript
var sound = new Howl({
  src: ['sound.webm', 'sound.mp3']
});

// Clear listener after first call.
sound.once('load', function(){
  sound.play();
});

// Fires when the sound finishes playing.
sound.on('end', function(){
  console.log('Finished!');
});
```

##### Control multiple sounds:
```javascript
var sound = new Howl({
  src: ['sound.webm', 'sound.mp3']
});

// Play returns a uniqe Sound ID that can be passed
// into any method on Howl to control that specific sound.
var id1 = sound.play();
var id2 = sound.play();

// Fade out the first sound and speed up the second.
sound.fade(1, 0, 1000, id1);
sound.rate(1.5, id2);
```

## Core

### Options
#### src `Array` `[]` *`required`*
The sources to the track(s) to be loaded for the sound (URLs or base64 data URIs). These should be in order of preference, howler.js will automatically load the first one that is compatible with the current browser. If your files have no extensions, you will need to explicitly specify the extension using the `format` property.
#### volume `Number` `1.0`
The volume of the specific track, from `0.0` to `1.0`.
#### html5 `Boolean` `false`
Set to `true` to force HTML5 Audio. This should be used for large audio files so that you don't have to wait for the full file to be downloaded and decoded before playing.
#### loop `Boolean` `false`
Set to `true` to automatically loop the sound forever.
#### preload `Boolean` `true`
Automatically begin downloading the audio file when the `Howl` is defined.
#### autoplay `Boolean` `false`
Set to `true` to automatically start playback when sound is loaded.
#### mute `Boolean` `false`
Set to `true` to load the audio muted.
#### sprite `Object` `{}`
Define a sound sprite for the sound. The offset and duration are defined in milliseconds. A third (optional) parameter is available to set a sprite as looping. An easy way to generate compatible sound sprites is with [audiosprite](https://github.com/tonistiigi/audiosprite).
```javascript
{
  key: [offset, duration, (loop)]
}
```
#### rate `Number` `1.0`
The rate of playback. 0.5 to 4.0, with 1.0 being normal speed.
#### pool `Number` `5`
The size of the inactive sounds pool. Once sounds are stopped or finish playing, they are marked as ended and ready for cleanup. We keep a pool of these to recycle for improved performance. Generally this doesn't need to be changed. It is important to keep in mind that when a sound is paused, it won't be removed from the pool and will still be considered active so that it can be resumed later.
#### format `Array` `[]`
howler.js automatically detects your file format from the extension, but you may also specify a format in situations where extraction won't work (such as with a SoundCloud stream).
#### onload `Function`
Fires when the sound is loaded.
#### onloaderror `Function`
Fires when the sound is unable to load. The first parameter is the ID of the sound (if it exists) and the second is the error message/code.
#### onplay `Function`
Fires when the sound begins playing. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.
#### onend `Function`
Fires when the sound finishes playing (if it is looping, it'll fire at the end of each loop). The first parameter is the ID of the sound.
#### onpause `Function`
Fires when the sound has been paused. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.
#### onstop `Function`
Fires when the sound has been stopped. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.
#### onmute `Function`
Fires when the sound has been muted/unmuted. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.
#### onvolume `Function`
Fires when the sound's volume has changed. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.
#### onrate `Function`
Fires when the sound's playback rate has changed. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.
#### onseek `Function`
Fires when the sound has been seeked. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.
#### onfade `Function`
Fires when the current sound finishes fading in/out. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.


### Methods
#### play([sprite/id])
Begins playback of a sound. Returns the sound id to be used with other methods. Only method that can't be chained.
* **sprite/id**: `String/Number` `optional` Takes one parameter that can either be a sprite or sound ID. If a sprite is passed, a new sound will play based on the sprite's definition. If a sound ID is passed, the previously played sound will be played (for example, after pausing it). However, if an ID of a sound that has been drained from the pool is passed, nothing will play.

#### pause([id])
Pauses playback of sound or group, saving the `seek` of playback.
* **id**: `Number` `optional` The sound ID. If none is passed, all sounds in group are paused.

#### stop([id])
Stops playback of sound, resetting `seek` to `0`.
* **id**: `Number` `optional` The sound ID. If none is passed, all sounds in group are stopped.

#### mute([muted], [id])
Mutes the sound, but doesn't pause the playback.
* **muted**: `Boolean` `optional` True to mute and false to unmute.
* **id**: `Number` `optional` The sound ID. If none is passed, all sounds in group are stopped.

#### volume([volume], [id])

Check if a sound is currently playing or not, returns a `Boolean`. If no sound ID is passed, check if any sound in the `Howl` group is playing.
* **id**: `Number` The sound ID to check.

#### duration([id])
Get the duration of the audio source. Will return 0 until after the `load` event fires.
* **id**: `Number` `optional` The sound ID to check. Passing an ID will return the duration of the sprite being played on this instance; otherwise, the full source duration is returned.

#### on(event, function, [id])
Listen for events. Multiple events can be added by calling this multiple times.
* **event**: `String` Name of event to fire/set (`load`, `loaderror`, `play`, `end`, `pause`, `stop`, `mute`, `volume`, `rate`, `seek`, `fade`).
* **function**: `Function` Define function to fire on event.

### Global Methods
The following methods are used to modify all sounds globally, and are called from the `Howler` object.
#### mute(muted)
Mute or unmute all sounds.
* **muted**: `Boolean` True to mute and false to unmute.

#### volume([volume])
Get/set the global volume for all sounds, relative to their own volume.
* **volume**: `Number` `optional` Volume from `0.0` to `1.0`.

#### codecs(ext)

## Plugin: Spatial

### Options
#### orientation `Array` `[1, 0, 0]`
Sets the direction the audio source is pointing in the 3D cartesian coordinate space. Depending on how direction the sound is, based on the `cone` attributes, a sound pointing away from the listener can be quiet or silent.
#### stereo `Number` `null`
Sets the stereo panning value of the audio source for this sound or group. This makes it easy to setup left/right panning with a value of `-1.0` being far left and a value of `1.0` being far right.
#### pos `Array` `null`
Sets the 3D spatial position of the audio source for this sound or group. Setting any value higher than `1.0` will begin to decrease the volume of the sound as it moves further away.
#### pannerAttr `Object`
Sets the panner node's attributes for a sound or group of sounds. See the `pannerAttr` method for all available options.
#### onstereo `Function`
Fires when the current sound has the stereo panning changed. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.
#### onpos `Function`
Fires when the current sound has the listener position changed. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.
#### onorientation `Function`
Fires when the current sound has the direction of the listener changed. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.


### Methods
#### stereo(pan, [id])
Get/set the stereo panning of the audio source for this sound or all in the group.
* **pan**: `Number` A value of `-1.0` is all the way left and `1.0` is all the way right.
* **id**: `Number` `optional` The sound ID. If none is passed, all in group will be updated.

#### pos(x, y, z, [id])
Get/set the 3D spatial position of the audio source for this sound or group. Setting any value higher than `1.0` will begin to decrease the volume of the sound as it moves further away.
* **x**: `Number` The x-position of the audio from `-1000.0` to `1000.0`.
* **y**: `Number` The y-position of the audio from `-1000.0` to `1000.0`.
* **z**: `Number` The z-position of the audio from `-1000.0` to `1000.0`.
* **id**: `Number` `optional` The sound ID. If none is passed, all in group will be updated.

#### orientation(x, y, z, [id])
Get/set the direction the audio source is pointing in the 3D cartesian coordinate space. Depending on the direction of the sound, based on the `cone` attributes, a sound pointing away from the listener can be quiet or silent.
* **x**: `Number` The x-orientation of the source.
* **y**: `Number` The y-orientation of the source.

  * **coneOuterAngle** `360` The volume will be reduced to a constant value of `coneOuterGain` outside this angle.
  * **coneOuterGain** `0` The amount of volume reduction outside of `coneOuterAngle`.
  * **distanceModel** `inverse` Determines algorithm to use to reduce volume as audio moves away from listener. Can be `linear`, `inverse` or `exponential.
  * **maxDistance** `10000` Volume won't reduce between source/listener beyond this distance.
  * **panningModel** `HRTF` Determines which spatialization algorithm is used to position audio. Can be `HRTF` or `equalpower`.
  * **refDistance** `1` A reference distance for reducing volume as the source moves away from the listener.
  * **rolloffFactor** `1` How quickly the volume reduces as source moves from listener.
* **id**: `Number` `optional` The sound ID. If none is passed, all in group will be updated.


### Global Methods
#### stereo(pan)
Helper method to update the stereo panning position of all current `Howls`. Future `Howls` will not use this value unless explicitly set.
* **pan**: `Number` A value of -1.0 is all the way left and 1.0 is all the way right.

#### pos(x, y, z)

#### orientation(x, y, z, xUp, yUp, zUp)
Get/set the direction the listener is pointing in the 3D cartesian space. A front and up vector must be provided. The front is the direction the face of the listener is pointing, and up is the direction the top of the listener is pointing. Thus, these values are expected to be at right angles from each other.
* **x**: `Number` The x-orientation of listener.
* **y**: `Number` The y-orientation of listener.
* **z**: `Number` The z-orientation of listener.
* **xUp**: `Number` The x-orientation of the top of the listener.
* **yUp**: `Number` The y-orientation of the top of the listener.
* **zUp**: `Number` The z-orientation of the top of the listener.


### Mobile Playback
By default, audio on iOS, Android, etc is locked until a sound is played within a user interaction, and then it plays normally the rest of the page session ([Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/audiovideo/conceptual/using_html5_audio_video/PlayingandSynthesizingSounds/PlayingandSynthesizingSounds.html)). The default behavior of howler.js is to attempt to silently unlock audio playback by playing an empty buffer on the first `touchend` event. This behavior can be disabled by calling:

```javascript
Howler.mobileAutoEnable = false;
```

### Dolby Audio Playback
Full support for playback of the Dolby Audio format (currently support in Edge and Safari) is included. However, you must specify that the file you are loading is `dolby` since it is in a `mp4` container.

```javascript
var dolbySound = new Howl({
  src: ['sound.mp4', 'sound.webm', 'sound.mp3'],
  format: ['dolby', 'webm', 'mp3']
});
```

### Format Recommendations
Howler.js supports a wide array of audio codecs that have varying browser support ("mp3", "opus", "ogg", "wav", "aac", "m4a", "mp4", "webm", ...), but if you want full browser coverage you still need to use at least two of them. If your goal is to have the best balance of small filesize and high quality, based on extensive production testing, your best bet is to default to `webm` and fallback to `mp3`. `webm` has nearly full browser coverage with a great combination of compression and quality. You'll need the `mp3` fallback for Internet Explorer.

It is important to remember that howler.js selects the first compatible sound from your array of sources. So if you want `webm` to be used before `mp3`, you need to put the sources in that order.

If you want your `webm` files to be seekable in Firefox, be sure to encode them with the cues element. One way to do this is by using the `dash` flag in [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/):

```
ffmpeg -i sound1.wav -dash 1 sound1.webm
```
